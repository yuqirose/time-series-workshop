                    Real world data in many domains is multimodal and heterogeneous, such as healthcare, social media, and climate science. Tensors, as generalizations of vectors and matrices, provide a natural and scalable framework for handling data with inherent structures and complex dependencies.  Recent renaissance of tensor methods in machine learning ranges from academic research on scalable algorithms for tensor operations, novel models through tensor representations, to industry solutions including Google TensorFlow，Torch and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).  In particular, scalable tensor methods have attracted considerable amount of attention, with successes in a series of learning tasks, such as learning latent variable models, relational learning, spatio-temporal forecasting and training deep neural networks. </br>

                    These progresses trigger new directions and problems towards tensor methods in machine learning. The workshop aims to foster discussion, discovery, and dissemination of research activities and outcomes in this area and encourages breakthroughs. We will bring together researchers in theories and applications who are interested in tensors analysis and development of tensor-based algorithms. We will also invite researchers from related areas, such as numerical linear algebra, high-performance computing, deep learning, statistics, data analysis, and many others, to contribute to this workshop. We believe that this workshop can foster new directions, closer collaborations and novel applications. We also expect a deeper conversation regarding why learning with tensors at current stage is important, where it is useful, what tensor computation software and hardware work well in practice and, how we can progress further with interesting research directions and open problems.

                            Our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of deep convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images.
I will present recent work that derive an equivalence between convolutional networks and hierarchical tensor decompositions. Under this equivalence, the structure of a network corresponds to the type of decomposition, and the network weights correspond to the decomposition parameters. This allows analyzing hypotheses spaces of networks by studying tensor spaces of corresponding decompositions, facilitating the use of algebraic and measure theoretical tools.  
Specifically, the results I will present  include showing how exponential depth efficiency is achieved in a family of deep networks called Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits, show that CAC is equivalent to SimNets, show that depth efficiency is superior to conventional ConvNets and show how inductive bias is tied to correlations between regions of the input image. In particular, 
correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given input partition, measures how far a function is from being separable.
I will show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others.
The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias.
Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images.
In addition to analyzing deep networks, I will show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth -- they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.

This work covers material recently presented in COLT, ICML and CVPR including recent Arxiv submissions. The work was jointly done with doctoral students Nadav Cohen and Or Sharir.

                        <p>Prof. Amnon Shashua holds the Sachs chair in computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His field of expertise is computer vision and machine learning. For his academic achievements he received the MARR prize Honorable Mention in 2001, the Kaye innovation award in 2004, and the Landau award in exact sciences in 2005.</p>
        <p>In 1999 Prof. Shashua co-founded Mobileye, an Israeli company developing a system-on-chip and computer vision algorithms for a driving assistance system, providing a full range of active safety features using a single camera. Today, approximately 11 million cars from 25 automobile manufacturers rely on Mobileye technology to make their vehicles safer to drive. In August 2014, Mobileye claimed the title for largest Israeli IPO ever, by raising $1B at a market cap of $5.3B. In addition, Mobileye is developing autonomous driving technology with more than a dozen car manufacturers. An early version of Mobileye’s autonomous driving technology was deployed in series as an "autopilot" feature in October, 2015, and will evolve to support more autonomous features in 2016 and beyond. The introduction of autonomous driving capabilities is of a transformative nature and has the potential of changing the way cars are built, driven and own in the future.</p>
        <p>In 2010 Prof. Shashua co-founded OrCam which harnesses computer vision artificial intelligence to assist people who are visually impaired or blind. The OrCam MyEye device is unique in its ability to provide visual aid to hundreds of millions of people, through a discreet wearable platform. Within its wide-ranging scope of capabilities, OrCam’s device can read most texts (both indoors and outdoors) and learn to recognize thousands of new items and faces.</p><br>

         From a theoretical perspective, low-rank tensor factorization is an
algorithmic miracle, allowing for (provably correct) reconstruction
and learning in a number of settings.  From a practical standpoint, we
still lack sufficiently robust, versatile, and efficient tensor
factorization algorithms, particularly for large-scale problems.  Many
of the algorithms with provable guarantees either suffer from an
expensive initialization step, and require the iterative removal of
rank-1 factors, destroying any sparsity that might be present in the
original tensor.  On the other hand, the most commonly used algorithm
in practice is "alternating least squares" [ALS], which iteratively
fixes all but one mode, and optimizes the remaining mode.  This
algorithm is extremely efficient, but often converges to bad local
optima, particularly when the weights of the factors are non-uniform.
In this work, we propose a modification of the ALS approach that
enjoys practically viable efficiency, as well as provable recovery
(assuming the factors are random or have small pairwise inner
products) even for highly non-uniform weights.  We demonstrate the
significant superiority of our recovery algorithm over the traditional
ALS on both random synthetic data, and on computing word embeddings
from a third-order word tri-occurrence tensor.

This is based on joint work with Vatsal Sharan.

                          <div id="vagelis" class="collapse, text-muted" >Tensors and tensor decompositions have been very popular and effective tools for analyzing
multi-aspect data in a wide variety of fields, ranging from Psychology to Chemometrics, 
and from Signal Processing to Data Mining and Machine Learning. 

Using tensors in the era of big data poses the challenge of scalability and efficiency. 
In this talk, I will discuss recent techniques on tackling this challenge
by parallelizing and speeding up tensor decompositions, especially
for very sparse datasets (such as the ones encountered for example 
in online social network analysis). 

In addition to scalability, I will also touch upon the challenge of 
unsupervised quality assessment, where in absence of ground truth, we seek
to automatically select the decomposition model that captures best the structure
in our data. 

The talk will conclude with a discussion on future research directions
and open problems in tensors for big data analytics.
